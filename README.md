# JAWT

Japanese With Texts. Kind of like Learning With Texts, but set up for
Japanese, with integrated morphological analysis. Kind of like LingQ,
but doesn't send you an email every day to see how you're feeling.

This is very early days; if you're not a developer, you should come
back later.

## Development
- clj: open a repl, (start)
- cljs: cider-connect-cljs -> localhost -> 7002 -> shadow-select -> :main -> refresh browser
ie

## Conventions
In cljs code, `state` indicates the component state atom, whereas `s`
indicates a state value.
